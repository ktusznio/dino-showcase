For 400 years African Americans were enslaved without human rights,
From jim crow to mass incarceration--we still press on against these plights,
  Europeans with guns armed to destroy,
Destroying the lands where time begun with military envoys,
Braving the waters in the Pinta, Mayflower, and Santa Maria,
Dying of thirst, stripped of their freedom was the idea
Secrets of the ancients were buried in these desert sands
Crying was motherland, burying her children young  really wasn't the plan
